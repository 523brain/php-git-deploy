# php-git-deploy
_PHP script for automatic code deployment directly from Github or BitBucket to your server using webhooks_

## Overview

Github and BitBucket offer webhook functionality to automate the deployment of your code to your servers.

This PHP script allows you to connect your repository with your server without any additional services. It creates a local repository in your server, from which it copies files to your production directory (e.g. document root in the case of a web server). 

In normal use, every time there is an update in the repository Github/BitBucket trigger this script by simply opening its URL. The script automatically ignores webhook triggers for events other than push and pull request merged, or for branches different than the one for which it is configured. The script fetches the repo from origin and checks out the most recent commit. Using rsync it adds and updates any files that have been changed in the repository directory since the last update, into the production directory, resets any files in the production directory that differ from the repo. Using the commit details it identifies files that have been removed from the repository, and deletes them from the production directory.

This script does not remove files that exist in your production directory and that don't exist in the repo (e.g. media files, configuration files).

The script keeps a version file in the production directory that saves the hash value of the latest commit that has been deployed.

A manual trigger mode is available that allows you to re-sync files, checkout a different commit, or a different branch.

## Requirements

* Medium to high technical skill level
* Access to your server command line
* Access to the user that runs PHP scripts (e.g. www-data)
* Access to your server production directory
* `git` and `rsync` must be installed
* `exec` must be allowed in PHP scripts
* Access to the repository

## Server Setup

If you are using a private repository start here. If you are using a public repository you can jump ahead to the point indicated below.

* Log in as the PHP user (e.g. www-data): 
```
% su www-data
```
* Create the directory for storing SSH keys: 
```
% mkdir ~/.ssh
```
* Change directory: 
```
% cd ~/.ssh
```
* Create keys for Github. When prompted use file name `github_rsa`. Leave passphrase blank: 
```
% ssh-keygen -t rsa
```
* Repeat the previous step for BitBucket, using file name `bitbucket_rsa`.
* Create a new file `config` that will tie specific servers with keys, add the following configuration for BitBucket:
```
Host bitbucket.org
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/bitbucket_rsa
```
or for GitHub:
```
Host github.com
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/github_rsa
```
* You must connect to the repository for the first time to verify the SSH keys. In the following commands replace BRANCH with the name of the branch, and REPOSITORY with the SSH address of your repository in Github or BitBucket (e.g. git@bitbucket.org:username/reponame.git). When prompted answer yes:
```
% mkdir ~/git
% cd ~/git
% git clone --depth=1 --branch BRANCH REPOSITORY
% rm -rf ~/git
```

NOTE: you can ignore the permission denied error message you will see at this point

If you are using a public repository you can start here.

* Download `deploy.php` and `deploy-config.orig.php` to your webserver, accessible via a public URL
* Rename `deploy-config.orig.php` to `deploy-config.php` and edit its configuration:
  * __REMOTE_REPOSITORY__: for public repositories you can use the HTTPS address (e.g. https://github.com/username/reponame.git), and for private repositories you will need to use the SSH address (e.g. git@bitbucket.org:username/reponame.git)
  * __BRANCH__: this is the array of branches allowed to deploy with this script. The first branch is the only one that will be allowed for webhook triggers from Github/BitBucket. The others will be allowed on manual triggers.
  * __ACCESS_TOKEN__: a secret string that must be configured to ensure some reasonable level of security and prevent abuse. More on security below.
  * __GIT_DIR__: the full path of the directory where the Git repository will be cloned. This should be different than the production directory, and should not be accessible publicly. Include the trailing slash.
  * __TARGET_DIR__: the full path of the directory of your production files. Include the trailing slash.
  * __TIME_LIMIT__: maximum time allowed for each command, in seconds. 60 should be fine unless your deployments are massive. Adjust if necessary.

## Repository Setup

If you are using a private repository you need to copy the public key to your repository:

* In the directory `~/.ssh` you will find a `.pub` file. That's your public key. 
* Copy its contents
* In both BitBucket and GitHub go to Settings > Deploy Keys (or Deployment Keys) > Add New
* Enter a name for the key and paste the content of the `.pub` file.

For both private and public repositories you need to configure the Webhooks:

* In both BitBucket and GitHub go to Settings > Webhooks > Add Webhook
* On URL (or Payload URL) enter the URL of the deploy script with your secret access token, for example: https://domain.com/deploy.php?t=ACCESS_TOKEN
* Choose the specific events that would trigger this webhook. For BitBucket: Push. For GitHub: Push, Pull Request 

## Deploy Different Branches to Different Environments

If you have multiple branches that you need to deploy to different environments, just copy the script and its configuration, and add its own webhook. For example, you can have a deploy script in your development server and in your production server, with different configurations and their own webhooks. This will allow you to deploy different branches to different environments.

## Manual Triggering

In addition to automatic deployment triggered by webhooks, you can use this script manually to force the deployment of a specific branch and/or commit.

You can open in your browser the same URL you configured in webhooks. This will deploy the default branch to the most recent commit:
```
https://domain.com/deploy.php?t=ACCESS_TOKEN
```
Note that you must have the secret access token to execute the script, otherwise you will get an access denied error.

To deploy a specific branch, use the `b` parameter, for example:
```
https://domain.com/deploy.php?t=ACCESS_TOKEN&b=BRANCH
```

To deploy a specific commit, use the `c` parameter with the short hash, for example:
```
https://domain.com/deploy.php?t=ACCESS_TOKEN&c=COMMIT
```

You can use the `b` and `c` parameters simultaneously to specify a branch and commit, for example:
```
https://domain.com/deploy.php?t=ACCESS_TOKEN&b=BRANCH&c=COMMIT
```

## Security Considerations

* Treat the ACCESS_TOKEN the same way you would treat a password: choose a long and hard-to-guess string, and keep it secret.
* If your development environment is protected with HTTP password, just add the username and password to the webhook URL as follows:
```
https://username:password@domain.com/deploy.php?t=ACCESS_TOKEN
```
* Ideally, the deploy script is accessible through an SSL connection (HTTPS), to minimize the risk of the ACCESS_TOKEN being intercepted.
* The script doesn't include any sanitation rules for the parameters that are read from the request because all of them pass through validation from configuration settings. If the values cannot be validated the script stops. Let me know if there is anything else that can be done to make this script more secure.
